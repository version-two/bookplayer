# BookPlayer: A PHP Web Audio Player

## Overview

BookPlayer is a web-based audio player built with PHP, designed to efficiently manage and play MP3 files directly from
your browser. It's ideal for audiobooks, music libraries, language learning materials, and more. The application is
equipped with features like volume and speed control, progress tracking, and language selection, offering a versatile
listening experience.

### Features

- **MP3 Playback:** Plays MP3 files seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Speed Control:** Adjust playback speed to your preference.
- **Volume Control:** Easy volume adjustment with a slider.
- **Progress Tracking:** Remembers playback position for each file.
- **Language Selection:** Supports multiple languages for the interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Listened Marking:** Mark files as listened or not listened.
- **Dark Mode Interface:** Comfortable for night-time listening.

## Installation

1. **Download index.php:**
   Just download the `index.php` file.

2. **Directory Setup:**
   Place the script in a PHP-supported server environment.

3. **MP3 files:**
   Drop some .mp3 files in the same directory and access the script.

## Demo

A live demonstration of the BookPlayer application is available at `https://showcase.v2.sk/bookplayer/`. Visit this link
to see it in action and understand how it functions. Please note that the actual performance might vary depending on the
server environment and the size and number of MP3 files being managed.

## Customization

### Editing `page.json` for Default Settings

- **Default Language, Title, and Subtitle:**
  Modify `page.json` in the `.metadata` directory to set these defaults:
    - `lang`: Default language code (e.g., "en").
    - `title`: Page title.
    - `subtitle`: Subtitle (supports HTML content).

### Editing Metadata Files for MP3 Files

- **Custom Titles and Descriptions:**
  Each MP3 file can have a metadata file `[filename].json` in `.metadata`.
  These files are generated automatically on page-load.
  Edit these files to set custom titles and descriptions (HTML supported) for each MP3.
  ```json
  {
  "name"       : "filename.mp3",        // Name of the file
  "size"       : 1234567,               // Size of the file in bytes
  "hash"       : "md5hash",             // MD5 hash of the file
  "duration"   : 360,                   // Pre-calculated duration of the file in seconds 
  "title"      : "Optional Title",      // [Optional] Title of the file such as chapter or custom name to display
  "description": "Optional Description" // [Optional] Description of the chapter / mp3 file.
  }
  ```
- **Automatic Regeneration of Metadata:**
  If an MP3 file changes, its metadata file is regenerated to update the duration. Custom titles and descriptions are
  retained.

### Creating Custom Translation Files

- **Creating and Registering:**
  Create a JSON file per language in `.metadata/lang` and register it in the `$settings` array in the PHP script.

## Usage

- **Accessing the Player:**
  Open `index.php` in a browser to access BookPlayer.
- **Adding MP3 Files:**
  Place MP3 files in the same directory as the script.
- **Playing Audio:**
  Click the 'Play' button next to an audio file or global 'Play / Resume' button to start / resume playback. Your
  progress on each file is saved to LocalStorage
- **Adjusting Volume and Speed:**
  Use the sliders in the settings modal. This setting is stored in LocalStorage.
- **Language Selection:**
  Choose a language from the settings modal.
- **Progress Tracking:**
  Playback progress is saved automatically.
- **Marking Files as Listened:**
  Mark files using the listened/not listened buttons. This data is stored in LocalStorage.

## Auto-Update
BookPlayer is now equipped with a feature to automatically check for updates and update itself. This is facilitated by a built-in auto-update function, `checkForUpdate()`, designed to run once per hour.

This function works in the following way:
- It retrieves the current PHP script from GitHub and compares it with the existing `index.php` on your local system.
- If differences are observed between the local and fetched versions of the script, the local file is automatically updated using the script received from GitHub.
- The update process automatically refreshes the page once completed.

To disable auto-update, make sure the `auto_update` field in your `.metadata/page.json` is set to `false`.

Please note that the function is set to trigger only when the duration between the last check and the current time exceeds an hour.
